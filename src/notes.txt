- add multi client game mode 

what needed?
- server
- has game state
- actions: accepting a coordinate from a specific player for a specific game 
- send back new game state to both players (websockets?)
-> or players can get new game state regularly

-options to create (reset, create new game), read (get games state), update (join & make moves, reset (maube just same as create new game?)), delete games 

const gameState = {
    gameId: "",
    board: [],
    currentPlayer: "X", 
    player1: {token: "x", id: ""},
    player2: {token: "x", id: ""},
    winState

}

- client 
- fetches game state (websockets, long polling)
- new lobby page to view all games that need more players 
- start a new game & let people join that 
- win modal (hit the server and create new game with the same players)
